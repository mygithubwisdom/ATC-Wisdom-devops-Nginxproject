ðŸš€ Diving into DevOps: Configuring NGINX on Azure ðŸ”¥ I'm thrilled to have completed the first step in my DevOps journey, DevOps Stage 0 â€“ NGINX Configuration, through the ATC Africa Mentorship Program/Internship! ðŸŽ‰ This involved creating an Ubuntu Virtual Machine (VM) on Azure, setting up an NGINX server, and customizing it to deliver a unique HTML page accessible to the public.

ðŸ”¹ The Challenge One significant obstacle I faced during the process was generating the correct SSH key for accessing the VM. Initially, I ended up with a .ppk key instead of the required .pem format, leading to authentication issues. After troubleshooting, I finally generated the correct .pem key and successfully connected to my server.

ðŸ”¹ What I Gained âœ… Configuring an NGINX web server on Ubuntu âœ… Using the nano editor to update /var/www/html/index.html âœ… Resolving SSH errors and understanding VM access âœ… Learning how web servers deliver static content âœ… A deeper appreciation for cloud infrastructure concepts.
ðŸ’¡ Tips for Beginners:

Always store your .pem key securely when creating a VM.

NGINX is a versatile tool to start learning DevOps principles.

Debugging isnâ€™t a setbackâ€”every error is a chance to grow!

This experience was a fascinating introduction to system administration and cloud computing. Many thanks to ATC Africa for this invaluable learning opportunity! ðŸ™Œ
